## Notes

Time was spent learning how to set up a Vite project and also parse through the default code. Originally I tried to make the directory for this a subdirectory of a large repo for WEB 102, but making subdirectory is quite hard actually so that was time wasted. I did use several CSS rules from the example site which helped, though the con with that is that because I don't understand all the seemingly boilerplate CSS or all the CSS that's given I wound up having difficulty getting things to line up with the correct padding or margins. Padding, margins, and messing with flex-box was quite challenging because they all influence each other so it's hard to see what is causing problems with my location setting. And I have no idea how to be forward thinking with CSS generally and for getting things to scale for smaller screens or window resizing.
